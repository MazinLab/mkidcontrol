Notes on Quenching:
- What is quenching? - The superconducting coil we're pushing through goes 'normal', it's no longer superconducting

- What causes a quench? - Ramping too fast, mechanical vibrations, exceeding the critical current (9.5 A, for our ADR)

- What is the solution? - To drop the voltage across the magnet/the current through the magnet.

- What is the 'smoking gun'? The voltage spiking across the magnet ( V = L * dI/dt + IR ). L~35H, if R_magnet spikes, V will spike accordingly

- What secondary effects occur? Device and LHe tank thermometers will read higher temps. Current should drop (it will with a voltage source, but PIC-C uses a current source, so this must be clarified).

- What time scale to act on? There's a few in the problem (faster is better, but how fast?). Heating occurs on 10s of seconds. 
Using a voltage source - The voltage spike occurs as quickly as the coil goes normal (there is no good time scale I can find for this). The current drop will occur on the same timescale.
From Clint - He has quenched DARKNESS's magnet before, recognizing the voltage spike and killing the current. This means 'human' timescales (seconds rather than ms,us,ns...)
Using a current source - There will not necessarily be current drop (because we're using a current source), but a voltage spike could be seen.

- Where have we seen quenches occur (in the cooldown cycle)? Between 6-7 A while ramping up. Not a guarantee this is where they always occur, but it's where they have in our documentation.

- A few general notes:
a. There is a voltage monitor on the HC Boost board to start, BUT our current wiring to the fridge does not have voltage taps.
b. DARKNESS ADR Operation link https://mazinlab.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAR/pages/289472518/DARKNESS+fridge+operation+notes
c. We can contact HPD about the necessary quench protection, but all of their manuals (online and what they sent to me) use voltage sources to control their magnets.
d. We can get back in touch with the PIPER people and find out how they handle quenches (they designed the HC Boost Board to work with a 35 H superconducting ADR, and so we're working in near exactly the same regime)
e. I've spoken with Clint and he sent me a pretty detailed email about what to look for/how this was managed in DARKNESS that's informed some of what I've written here
