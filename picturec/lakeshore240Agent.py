Program for communicating with and controlling the LakeShore240 Thermometry Unit.
This module is responsible for reading out 2 temperatures, that of the LN2 tank and the LHe tank.
Both are identical LakeShore DT-670A-CU diode thermometers. Using the LakeShore MeasureLink desktop application, the
LakeShore can be configured easily (it autodetects the thermometers and loads in the default calibration curve). There
will be functionality in the lakeshore240Agent to configure settings, although that should not be necessary unless the
thermometers are removed and replaced with new ones.
Again, the calibration process can be done manually using the LakeShore GUI if so desired.
