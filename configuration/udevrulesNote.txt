Notes about creating udev rules for picturec devices
    - The ArduinoUNO (currentduino) and ArduinoMEGA (hemttempAgent) udev rules are based on the
        serial numbers from the devices themselves.
    - The SIM921 and SIM960 (AC Resistance Bridge / PID Controller) use RS232-to-USB converters
        so their udev rules are based on the FTDI chips in the USB-to-RS232 cable.
        - Each cable will be labelled with the device it goes to to avoid confusion.
